The next state, which is given to agent 1 and used to select the max value action that agent 1 can take, should be the state after agent_2's action is taken. So in Q-learning, the true target value is always 0 unless it is the very before the termination state(where reward is not zero). Because it tries to use the estimation of non-existing state."
